Method Description: 

Collaborative filtering Baseline only algorithm.

1. I used the pandas library to read the dataset. Since the dataset is sparse, matrix factorisation is needed to obtain an RMSE < 1.
2. The scikit-surprise library offers a variety of options for recommendation systems. Out of these, the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method works out to be the best one. ALS is a matrix factorization algorithm that scales well to large datasets. Since the yelp dataset is large and fits the criteria, ALS works well for this type of dataset.
3. Obtaining a good RMSE involves manually tuning the parameters to get the optimum score.  I used number of epochs: 9, regularisation parameter for user: 7.6, regularisation parameter for items: 3.5
